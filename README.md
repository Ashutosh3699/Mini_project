The system is built using C++ with the help of OOPs and standard template library. The system comprises several entities and their relationships, such as Product, Customer, Order, Shopping Cart, Payment, Shipping, Admin, and Inventory, which are crucial for the system's functionality and scalability. In order to ensure a successful implementation, these entities and their relationships must be carefully designed and implemented.
